## Internships

### During the internship

In case of hybrid or in-presence internships, the first day that the students come to FBK, the internal tutor has to take them to the Safety office to collect the badge (north building, ground floor, near the bar). A prerequisite for the badge to be prepared is that students send a passport photo (*fototessera*) to the Safety office via mail *at least one working day before their first day*. 
Credentials to the FBK account should be sent to the student to the mail address specified in the new internship request; otherwise, collect the credentials from the Safety office.

Students have to follow some courses:
- Course "**Privacy Base**" on FBK Academy;
- Course "**FBK tra organizzazione, processi e rischi**" on FBK Academy;
- Course "**Sicurezza Base - Modulo Generale**" (if the student has already completed this course, for instance at the university, he/she can sent the certificate to help-safety@fbk.eu to validate it);
- Course "**Sicurezza Base - Modulo Specifico (rischio basso)**" (if the student has already completed this course, for instance at the university, he/she can sent the certificate to help-safety@fbk.eu to validate it).

Please note that, with respect to the safety courses, the *Modulo Generale* must be attended before the *Modulo Specifico*.

During the internship, the students have to fill the *Certificato parte prima* by writing the amount of hours for every day.

### At the end of the internship
At the end of the internship, the FBK supervisor has to check and sign the *Certificato parte prima* filled in by the students, also marking a final evaluation.

Students have to:
- fill in the evaluation questionnaire related to the internship;
- upload through the [official apply](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRn8x98wZEIyk2XWJeke0SyV8O_4TcxSL2BBM3Dsdf_6dUGw/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) the following document:
  - the *Certificato parte prima* signed by the FBK supervisor;
  - the final report on the internship, following the indications by JobGuidance.

## Thesis
### Request
After the supervisor places a request for a thesis period, the students will be contacted by the FBK office. On the one hand, they need to fill in their personal data through a specific link; on the other hand, they need to provide some documents:
- the *lettera di accettazione* by FBK;
- the *dichiarazione tutor ricerca tesi* by the university supervisor.

Both these documents will be provided by the FBK supervisor, and the students need to send them to their university department. After the confirmation from the university department, they need to send the same document to the FBK employee who is responsible for the procedure (the one who sent the initial instructions via email).

### During the thesis period

No specific bureaucracy will be required during this period in terms of timetables to fill.

Remember that students need to send to the university the request for discussing their thesis **at least a month** before the date chosen for the discussion. The request should also include the first page of the thesis (*frontespizio*) containing the title of the thesis and signed by the supervisors.

Finally, it is a good idea to organize a **rehearsal of the presentation of the thesis** for all graduating students in the week(s) before the discussion. The rehearsal should be open for partecipation to all students and the whole cyber security center.

### At the end of the thesis period

No specific bureaucracy will be required after the end of the thesis period, neither from FBK nor from the University (at least, from UniTN).
