# A Risk Assessment Methodology for VSNF Placement in Cloud Native Applications
#### Soldera Marco

In this repository can be found the code in Pyhton language developed in the context of a novel methodology for VSNF placement in cloud native applications. We have developed two main parts. The code "combinations.py" computes all the possible combinations of groups of attacks to recreate the initial list of attacks. In this way we can find the best combination of VSNF based on the cost function. The other cose is "optimization.py". It is about optimizing the graph with all the VSNF chains when they are nearby and with common functions.
