# Template Repository for Internships and Theses

This GitLab repository contains useful information and resources for students doing internships and theses in the Center for Cybersecurity of FBK:
* [how to use Git(Lab)](./GITLAB.md): information and commands on the Git software and the GitLab service;
* [LaTeX Guidelines and Best Practices plus Thesis Template](./tex/README.md): LaTeX guidelines and best practices for writing scientific publications plus pointers to the template for theses (@DISI, UniTN);
* [communication Kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R3G0JOhmxSQ3iELm9HBvswOcaD3uwywC?usp=sharing): shared Drive folder with institutional FBK material such as logos and templates for presentations;
* [bureaucracy](./BUREAUCRACY.md): bureaucratic information on how to start and conclude an internship or thesis.


Please read the following working best practices:
* as soon as the internship or thesis period starts, schedule a **weekly meeting** with the supervisors;
* always send emails from the institutional mail address (i.e., `@fbk.eu`) for communications related to the internship or the thesis. Remember to always add **all** the supervisors as recipients (e.g., in CC), even though not directly involved. For quick messages, it is also possible to use the GMail (group) chat.
* in case of doubts, do not wait for the weekly meeting to **ask the supervisors for clarifications** on the activities of the internship and thesis. Instead, contact them via email or chat directly;




Please read the following guidelines on how to maintain this repository during the internship or thesis:
* always keep this README file **up to date** with:
    * the (brief) summary of **daily activities**;
    * the minute (i.e., notes) of **each** meeting done with the supervisors (see [the dedicated file](./MINUTE.md) for more information);
    * references to **related work** (see [the dedicated README](./related/README.md) for more information);
    * any other **relevant information** on the current status of the internship or thesis;
* always **use folders to organize this repository**. Each folder should have its own README file;
* always choose **meaningful Git commit messages**, written in simple english;
* to save space, use the [`.gitignore` file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) to automatically exclude from the remote repository temporary or derivative files (e.g., LaTeX `.pdf` files, compiled `C/C++` executables). Note that common `.gitignore` files (e.g., for Java projects) are already available and can be found with a simple Internet search.
