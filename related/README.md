# Related Work

This folder should contain references, comments and other useful information on any **material** used during or related to the internship or thesis (i.e., the "**related work**"), such as scientific publications, blogs, white papers, repositories, presentations and videos. This information is especially important for the writing of the thesis.

For each related work, there should be a summary (usually from 100 to 200 words) describing the main idea and characteristics expressed in the related work. Also, report a stable link to the source of the related work (e.g., DOI, URL). If a stable link is not available, include the material (e.g., the `.pdf` file) in this folder. For files whose size is >10MB, use GDrive and report here the shared link.

Please check the [corresponding section in the LaTeX template](../tex/sections/3_related_work.tex) for other useful information about related work and where to find it.
