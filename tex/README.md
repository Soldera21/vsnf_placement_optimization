# LaTeX Guidelines and Best Practices

At [this link](https://gitlab.fbk.eu/st/people/StefanoBerlato/latex_handbook), you can find a LaTeX project containing guidelines and best practices for writing scientific publications. You can either import the LaTeX project into [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (recommended) or [install LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) on your PC or MAC.


## Thesis Template

Please refer to the official website of the University of Trento for the LaTeX template to use for the writing of the thesis:
* [Unitn, DISI, bachelor degree (Italian)](https://infostudenti.unitn.it/it/conseguimento-titolo-lauree-disi);
* [Unitn, DISI, master degree (Italian)](https://infostudenti.unitn.it/it/conseguimento-titolo-lauree-magistrali-disi);
* [Unitn, DISI, master degree (English)](https://infostudenti.unitn.it/en/masters-degree-information-engineering-computer-science);

Besides the thesis, students are expected to prepare a presentation for the graduation session. Please use [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gd_32VjWZHSHSq2jv3J4QObDbFX5zfIFwuuSUb3fPco/edit?usp=sharing) to prepare the presentation. You can ask your supervisor for examples of presentations from last years.
